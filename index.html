At no point in time during our stay we felt we were in a hotel. It’s definitely a home away from home. Most definitely visiting again.</p>

                            And the host uncle is a very warm and energetic person. The best part about his cooking, is that all ingredients are organic, including home made wines.
                            The best part of the stay was, that the birds used to wake us up in the morning. Will surely visit again 👍</p>

He prepared homemade dishes n juices which are really rich in taste n health. He is very nice n interactive. Property is also very good, lively n full of nature. After a very long time, saw variety of birds in the house. One of the best homestay experience.</p>
